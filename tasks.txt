Challenge: Friend, we are close, I can taste success on the wind, we finally located Paracelsus lab, we will become rich beyond belief,
we will rule. All that is needed is cracking the access code, I have been looking at this for days and beyond the inkling that it is an alchemical
formula I have no idea. Can you give it a shoot and get us one step closer to the future that we deserve? This 
is the code “☉☿☽♂☉”, but what it encodes into is a mysteri. Pleace crack it.

'Your work was examplary, unfortunatlyt it turnes out we where not as close as first belived.
The code only gave us access to a note with a poem, the evil bastard had dusted it with Berulium powder so several of our alcylots are nolonger among us.
We must be more carefull in the future. Anyways the poem read “Still flows the Icy Lethe, Veiling all ’neath Eldritch Rime.”, can you make anything of it?'

Damn it! The poem was just another step. I refuse to believe Paracelsus would leave us with nothing.
There’s something in these words, some ancient wisdom we are failing to grasp. 
When we pored silver in to the next lock, we found another note, it is referencing an old alchemical codex hidden deep in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica.
The archive is online now, but because most of our aclolyotes are down for the count we need your help. We know the book in question is 
“Chirurgische Bücher und Schrifften” it is reported to be written in 1618, but we belive it is older considering that our latest note from the past is older. 
This is a transcript of the note.

through Hidden experiments, the Observing Philosophers 
carefully recorded their findings in secret tomes.
rarely did alchemists Seek answers in mundane texts,
for the Universal substance eluded ordinary understanding.

beyond the limits of ordinary Methods, the most Dedicated scholars
turned to alchemical science, where hidden truths awaited discovery.
Truly, the masters of old knew that one must strive tirelessly,
purifying Lead into something greater, refining both mind and matter.
until mastery was achieved, Knowledge alone was insufficient,
and only those who understood the deeper mysteries Would glimpse Immortality.

secrets, carefully veiled Behind Cryptic inscriptions,
teach those with patience to decode their deeper meaning.
hermetic ideals demand perseverance, a willingness to question,
and an acceptance that the path to wisdom is rarely direct.
long nights spent in study and contemplation lead to illumination,
and oaths taken by true seekers bind them to their Noble quest.
Yet the philosopher’s stone remains Elusive,
and only through great sacrifice is the truth Revealed.

elixirs, said to restore itality and even grant eternal youth,
were concocted by those who dared to challenge nature’s limits.
distillations, performed under the guidance of celestial alignments,
promised insight beyond mortal comprehension.
Gold, though treasured by the common man, held greater meaning
to those who understood the principle of transmutation.
Joining knowledge of the material and the divine,
true alchemists saw wealth not in metal, but in enlightenment.

notable are those who pursued the Quintessence,
a substance believed to bind together the four classical elements.
wielders of this hidden force were said to shape reality itself,
while Xenon and other elusive Vapors symbolized the mysteries of the aether.
yields of failed experiments were many,
but each failure brought the dedicated scholar closer to true wisdom.
Zeal alone was not enough—patience, discipline, and intellect
were the true keys to unlocking the universe’s greatest secret.

through the Forgotten knowledge of Ancient scholars,
keepers of wisdom have safeguarded the elusive
keys to transformation. only those who
fully commit to the pursuit of enlightenment
can grasp the final mysteries.
