# Exam_Unit_3

(Commit 1 - 4)
First off I start with creating the functions as I did in the previous non exam unit, the idea is to create the functions first, then afterwards 
refactor to follow functional programming principals. I use the try/catch method to do preliminary tests on the functions, to see if they return the
expected value or not.

Code is encoded in alchemical symbols. In order: Gold (Au), Quicksilver(Hg), Silver(Ag), Iron(Fe) and Gold(Au). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol
To make it easier to work with the code later in the game, I decided to start working with FP principals now instead of later when everything is done. After I've completed
the higher order function, I'm going to run tests.

(Commit 8 - 10)
Added testing framework, going to start figuring out how to run the test properly.
I decided to figure out if I could solve the task or not. I tweaked a lot, and finally found the right input, I tried all different kind of combinations.
I also figured out my code didn't output the challenge due to having wrongly coded the next challenge part.

My first thought was greek mythology, as "Lethe" was one of the rivers from the underworld of Hades, I already knew this but had to google for sure. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe. I started googling a bit, until I realized there was something off with the poem... Looking at the capital letters, it spells out the word SILVER...
