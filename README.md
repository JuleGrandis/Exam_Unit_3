# Exam_Unit_3

(Commit 1 - 4)
First off I start with creating the functions as I did in the previous non exam unit, the idea is to create the functions first, then afterwards 
refactor to follow functional programming principals. I use the try/catch method to do preliminary tests on the functions, to see if they return the
expected value or not.
