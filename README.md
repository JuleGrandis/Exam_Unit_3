# Exam_Unit_3

(Commit 1 - 4)
First off I start with creating the functions as I did in the previous non exam unit, the idea is to create the functions first, then afterwards 
refactor to follow functional programming principals. I use the try/catch method to do preliminary tests on the functions, to see if they return the
expected value or not. 

(Commit 5 - 7)
Code is encoded in alchemical symbols. In order: Gold (Au), Quicksilver(Hg), Silver(Ag), Iron(Fe) and Gold(Au). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol
To make it easier to work with the code later in the game, I decided to start working with FP principals now instead of later when everything is done. After I've completed
the higher order function, I'm going to run tests.

(Commit 8 - )
Added testing framework, going to start figuring out how to run the test properly.
